<b>Process</b>

<li> This assignment involved a great deal of trial and error</li>
<li> I tried for a long time to get a make script to work but to no avail </li>
<li> I ended up using a master R script similar to the one that Jenny created for her Lord of the Rings example </li>
<li> I can see why make and pipelines are used, but for the projects I work on I don't think that splitting code into more than one file will be useful to me.</li>
<li> I learned with this assignment how to render md documents straight from R files (as opposed to R Markdown files)</li>
<li> However, I could not successfully render the master script as a .md file because any file that contained its own render script would execute in a loop forever. That's why the master script is an html file.</li>
